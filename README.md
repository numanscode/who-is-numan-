> **hello world**
>
> You just tripped and fell into the most chaotic, meme-fueled, coffee-powered repo on GitHub. No code, just vibes, memes, and the color **rgb(230, 20, 55)**. If you're not running on caffeine and existential dread, are you even a dev?

## 🤔 About Me
Hey! I'm **Numan** — your local sleep-deprived, meme-obsessed, coffee-guzzling dev. I:
- Can spot a bug faster than my WiFi drops
- Have a playlist for every mood (lofi, synthwave, and "existential crisis at 3am")
- Will always pick the red Skittle (fight me)
- Am probably thinking about pizza, coffee, or both
- Believe in the power of Ctrl+Z and a good nap
- Debug my life with rubber ducks and existential memes
- Love all things quirky, diverse, and inclusive (everyone's welcome here!)

If you're reading this, you're officially part of the squad. 🦄

- I love fun videos with pandas ([click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ))
- I have a black belt in Googling (Stack Overflow is my dojo)
- I can touch my toes (on a good day, after stretching, maybe)
- I once ate an entire pizza by myself (no regrets, only carbs)
- I've never been rickrolled... or have I? (see above)
- I code in dark mode only (light mode is for the bold)
- My spirit animal is a caffeinated squirrel
