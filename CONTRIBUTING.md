## 🦄 The Golden Rules of Contribution

1. **No Boring Code Allowed!**
   - If your PR doesn't make someone giggle, snort, or question reality, try again.
2. **Every PR Must Contain:**
   - At least one joke, meme, pun, or fun fact. Bonus points for dad jokes and existential riddles.
   - A creative emoji in the title. (The more obscure, the better. 🦑🪐🦕)
3. **Seriousness is Forbidden.**
   - If you're about to write something serious, take a deep breath, do a silly dance, and rewrite it with 42% more whimsy.
4. **Kindness is Mandatory.**
   - Be excellent to each other. Channel your inner golden retriever.
5. **Surprise Me!**
   - Easter eggs, ASCII art, and hidden messages are highly encouraged.
6. **Goldfish Review Board**
   - All PRs are reviewed by my pet goldfish, Sir Bubbles III. He's tough but fair.
