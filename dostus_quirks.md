# 🤪 Dostu’s Quirks: A Case Study in Chaos

> *“Am I a free-spirited weirdo or just glitching through society in style?”* — Dostu, probably

---

## 👄 Public Menace on Wheels

If you ever hear a banshee singing *Channa Mereya* at full volume on a two-wheeler, that's not a ghost — that's me processing oppression through musical road rage. Therapy? Nah. Roadside concerts? Always. 😼

## 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩 Bikinis, But Make It Imaginary

I own bikinis the way billionaires own private islands — never used, but emotionally essential. One day, society. One day I shall strut. 🤨

---

## ☝🏿 Calorie Counting (But for What?)

I count my calories with precision, just to confirm I’m in a **daily surplus**. It’s like watching my own slow-burn villain arc, one paneer paratha at a time. ❤️‍🔥

---

## 🤯 Reading Speed: Buffering...

I read slower than dial-up internet. My brain processes novels like they’re ancient scrolls. Delayed? Yes. Determined? Also yes.

---

## 👀 Grape Skittles or We Riot

I worship purple-wine-grape Skittles. Blue Skittles can go to jail. Red Skittles? Overrated propaganda. I will die on this artificially flavored hill. 🫵🏿

---

## 👍🏿 Paint > Painting

I love *playing* with paint — the vibe, the chaos, the mess. Actual painting? Absolute disaster. My art looks like it went through a breakup. Again. 🤪

---

## 🥵 I Type With Pain, Not Passion

Thanks to Carpal Tunnel, I type like a haunted Victorian ghost writing angry letters with a quill. Technically apahich. Spiritually undefeated.

---

## 😼 Sitcom Soul

If it doesn’t have a laugh track or at least one neurotic character yelling about laundry — I don’t want it. Comedy is the only genre that gets me. 👉🏿👈🏿

---

## 💋 Alfredo Pasta is My God

Alfredo pasta is my comfort food, my personality, and possibly my only functioning relationship.

---

## 🤨 Existential Crisis, Always

Not sure why I’m doing anything. But I am. Probably for the plot twist. Or the pasta.

---

## 🫵🏿 Angry Round Things Are My People

I love fat, angry creatures. Especially small ones. Like a rotund cat having a tantrum. They understand me on a spiritual level. 😼

---

## 👄 Eyeliner? Eyemotion.

I have **never** drawn the same eyeliner twice. Every morning is a surprise. Today it’s “winged dagger,” tomorrow it’s “chaotic crow feather.”

---

## 👀 Doomscroll Queen

I scroll Twitter and Instagram like I’m mining for truth. Last time I had a Twitter fight, someone shamed... **my feet**. Yes. Feet. The internet remains undefeated.

---

## ✨ Summary

Dostu = Roadside opera singer with sore wrists, reading slowly about pastas and purple Skittles while painting emotional trauma in eyeliner form.

> ✨ “I contain multitudes, mostly carbs and eyeliner.” ✨
