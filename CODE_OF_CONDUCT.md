# 🌈 Code of Conduct: Numan Edition

Welcome, brave traveler, to the **Who is Numan** repo! Here, the vibes are high, the memes are dank, and the only bugs allowed are rubber ducks. To keep this place legendary, please abide by the following sacred (and slightly silly) rules:

## 🦄 The Laws of the Land
- **Be Excellent to Each Other:** Channel your inner Bill & Ted. Kindness is mandatory, sarcasm is optional (but encouraged).
- **Share Only Good Vibes:** If you're not radiating positivity, at least bring a meme.
- **No Negativity, Only Puns:** If you must roast, make it a dad joke. If you must vent, do it in haiku.
- **Respect All Contributors:** Real, imaginary, rubber duck, goldfish, or cat-on-keyboard—everyone's voice matters.
- **Celebrate Diversity:** Like a bag of Skittles, but with more caffeine. All flavors welcome.
- **PRs Must Contain at Least One Meme:** Or a fun fact. Or a pun. Or a picture of your pet. (Bonus points for all four.)
- **Goldfish Has Final Say:** If the goldfish reviewer is asleep, please wait for a splash of approval.
- **No Gatekeeping:** Unless you're guarding the coffee machine. Then, proceed with caution.
- **Dance Breaks Encouraged:** If the README makes you groove, you're doing it right.
- **Creativity is Law:** The weirder, the better. Shine bright, code weird.

## 🚨 Forbidden Spells
- No hate, discrimination, or bad vibes. (We have a strict "no trolls under the bridge" policy.)
- No spamming, flaming, or summoning ancient bugs.
- No stealing memes without proper attribution. (Honor among memers!)

## 🏆 Rewards
- Good vibes may be immortalized in the Hall of Fame.
- Dank memes may be featured in the README.
- Legendary contributors may receive a virtual high-five from Numan (and possibly the goldfish).

## 📝 Final Word
Let's make this the happiest, weirdest, most inclusive repo on GitHub. If you see someone breaking the rules, gently remind them with a meme or a rubber duck.

> "May your code compile, your memes be spicy, and your coffee cup never empty."

Now go forth and spread the vibes! ✨
